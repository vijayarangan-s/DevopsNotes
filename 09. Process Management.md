Process management in Linux involves **starting, monitoring, and controlling processes** (programs in execution). Here’s a comprehensive guide to the most important commands and concepts:

---

## 🧠 **Key Concepts**

* **Process ID (PID):** Unique ID assigned to each process.
* **Foreground process:** Tied to the terminal, blocks it until completion.
* **Background process:** Runs independently of the terminal.

## 🛠️ **Common Process Management Commands**

### 🔍 View Processes

* `ps` – Show current user’s running processes.

  * `ps aux` – Show all running processes with details.
  * `ps -ef` – Full-format list (same as `aux`).
* `top` – Live view of processes.
* `htop` – Interactive version of `top` (needs to be installed).
* `pidof <process_name>` – Get PID of a running process.
* `pgrep <name>` – Find processes by name.

### 🏃 Start/Run a Process

* `./script.sh` – Run in foreground.
* `./script.sh &` – Run in background.
* `nohup ./script.sh &` – Run in background, ignore hangups (session-safe).

### ⚙️ Manage Running Processes

* `jobs` – List background jobs in the current shell.
* `fg %1` – Bring job 1 to foreground.
* `bg %1` – Resume job 1 in background.

### 🛑 Stop/Kill a Process

* `kill <PID>` – Gracefully stop a process.
* `kill -9 <PID>` – Forcefully terminate a process.
* `pkill <name>` – Kill processes by name.
* `killall <process_name>` – Kill all instances of a process.

## 📈 Process Priority and Scheduling

* `nice -n <value> <command>` – Run a command with given priority (default: 0, range: -20 \[high] to 19 \[low]).
* `renice <priority> -p <PID>` – Change priority of a running process.

## 📦 Example Workflow

```bash
ps aux | grep node        # Find your node process
kill -9 12345             # Kill the process with PID 12345
./server.sh &             # Start a server script in the background
jobs                      # See background jobs
fg %1                     # Bring job 1 to foreground
```
