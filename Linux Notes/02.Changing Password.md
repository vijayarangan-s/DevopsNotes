# 🧠 `passwd` Command – Tips & Tricks in Linux

The `passwd` command is used for changing user passwords, but it can do more than just that! Here are some useful tricks:

---

## 🔁 1. Change Your Own Password

```bash
passwd
```

- Prompts for current password, then new password (typed twice).

---

## 👤 2. Change Password for Another User (As Root)

```bash
sudo passwd username
```

- You **don’t need** the user’s current password.
- Example:

```bash
sudo passwd alice
```

---

## 🔒 3. Lock a User Account

```bash
sudo passwd -l username
```

- Prevents the user from logging in.

---

## 🔓 4. Unlock a User Account

```bash
sudo passwd -u username
```

- Re-enables a previously locked account.

---

## ⛔ 5. Expire a Password (Force Change at Next Login)

```bash
sudo passwd -e username
```

- Forces the user to **set a new password** on next login.

---

## 🔐 6. Set Password Without Prompting (from a Script)

```bash
echo "username:password" | sudo chpasswd
```

**Example:**

```bash
echo "john:NewPass123" | sudo chpasswd
```

---

## ⏳ 7. View Password Expiry Info

```bash
chage -l username
```

- Shows when the password was last changed, when it will expire, etc.

---

## 🛡️ 8. Force Password Change Periodically

```bash
sudo chage -M 30 username
```

- Forces password change every 30 days.

---

## 🧼 9. Delete a User’s Password (Makes Account Passwordless)

```bash
sudo passwd -d username
```

- Useful for setting up no-password login (not recommended for secure systems).
