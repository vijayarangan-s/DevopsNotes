# Linux File Permissions: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners

Understanding file permissions is essential for working with Linux. Here's a beginner-friendly breakdown:

## 1. Understanding Permission Basics

Linux has three types of permissions for files and directories:
- **Read (r)**: View file contents or list directory contents
- **Write (w)**: Modify file or directory contents
- **Execute (x)**: Run a file as a program or enter a directory

These permissions are assigned to three categories of users:
- **Owner (u)**: The user who owns the file
- **Group (g)**: Users who are in the file's group
- **Others (o)**: All other users

## 2. Viewing Permissions

Use the `ls -l` command to see permissions:

```bash
ls -l filename
```

Example output:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 2048 Jan 1 10:00 filename
```

The first part (`-rw-r--r--`) shows:
- First character: `-` for file, `d` for directory
- Next 3: Owner permissions (rw-)
- Next 3: Group permissions (r--)
- Last 3: Others permissions (r--)

## 3. Changing Permissions with chmod

### Symbolic Method (easier to understand):

```bash
chmod [who][operator][permission] filename
```

- **Who**: u (user), g (group), o (others), a (all)
- **Operator**: + (add), - (remove), = (set exactly)
- **Permission**: r, w, x

Examples:
```bash
chmod u+x script.sh    # Add execute for owner
chmod go-w file.txt    # Remove write for group and others
chmod a=rw shared.txt  # Set read-write for everyone
```

### Numeric Method (more concise):

Each permission has a value:
- r = 4
- w = 2
- x = 1

Add them up for each category (owner, group, others):

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```
- 7 (owner): 4+2+1 (rwx)
- 5 (group): 4+0+1 (r-x)
- 5 (others): 4+0+1 (r-x)

Common permission sets:
- `755`: Executable files (rwxr-xr-x)
- `644`: Regular files (rw-r--r--)
- `700`: Private files (rwx------)

## 4. Changing Ownership with chown

Change file owner and/or group:
```bash
chown user:group filename
```

Examples:
```bash
chown alice report.txt      # Change owner to alice
chown alice:staff file.txt  # Change owner to alice and group to staff
```

## 5. Special Permissions

There are also special permissions:
- **Setuid (4)**: File executes as owner
- **Setgid (2)**: File executes as group, or files in directory inherit group
- **Sticky bit (1)**: Only owner can delete files in directory

Set with chmod by adding a fourth digit:
```bash
chmod 4755 script.sh  # Setuid
chmod 2775 shared_dir # Setgid
chmod 1777 /tmp       # Sticky bit
```

## 6. Default Permissions (umask)

The `umask` determines default permissions for new files. Common values:
- `022`: New files get 644, directories get 755
- `002`: New files get 664, directories get 775

View current umask:
```bash
umask
```

Set new umask:
```bash
umask 022
```

## Best Practices for Beginners

1. Start with restrictive permissions and loosen as needed
2. Never use `777` (read-write-execute for everyone) - it's a security risk
3. Use groups to manage access for multiple users
4. For scripts you want to execute, remember to add the execute permission
