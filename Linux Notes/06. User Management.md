If you're logged in as that user via terminal:
```bash
exit

passwd

It will prompt for your current password, then ask you to enter a new one.

### âœ… **2. Change Another Userâ€™s Password (as root or with sudo)**

```bash
sudo passwd username

Replace `username` with the actual username. Example:

```bash
sudo passwd newusername
```

Then set the new password when prompted.

Let me know if you want to enforce a password policy or expire a password too.
