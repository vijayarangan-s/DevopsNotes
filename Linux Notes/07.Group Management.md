### ✅ **1. Create a Group**

```bash
sudo groupadd groupname
```

Example:
```bash
sudo groupadd devteam
```

---

### ✅ **2. Add a User to a Group**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

Example:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG devteam newusername
```

🔹 `-aG` means **append to group**. Without `-a`, it would overwrite the user's existing groups.

---

### ✅ **3. Remove a User from a Group**

You can manually edit the group file or use `gpasswd`:

```bash
sudo gpasswd -d username groupname
```

Example:
```bash
sudo gpasswd -d newusername devteam
```

---

### ✅ **4. List Users in a Group**

```bash
getent group groupname
```

Example:
```bash
getent group devteam
```

Or use:
```bash
grep groupname /etc/group
```

---

### ✅ **5. List Groups for a User**

```bash
groups username
```

Example:
```bash
groups newusername
```

---

### ✅ **6. Delete a Group**

```bash
sudo groupdel groupname
```

Example:
```bash
sudo groupdel devteam
```

---

### ❓ **What Happens to Users After Group Deletion?**

- The **group is removed** from `/etc/group`.
- Users are **no longer associated** with that group.
- It **does NOT affect the user account**.
- If the deleted group was a user’s **primary group**, it may cause issues — but `groupdel` will **fail** if it's still in use as a primary group.

You can check a user’s primary group using:

```bash
id username
```
